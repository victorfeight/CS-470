# CS-470

As per my professor, 'Due to the nature of cloud services and the security features that create unique IDs, it would be both redundant and a security risk to post any of the AWS code to GitHub. This is why the only artifact for your GitHub portfolio for CS 470 is the Final Reflection, which contains a link to your presentation video.'

Due to the nature of cloud services and the security features that create unique IDs, it would be both redundant and a
security risk to post any of the AWS code to GitHub. This is why the only artifact for your GitHub
portfolio for CS 470 is the Final Reflection, which contains a link to your presentation video.

Code from:
https://angular-templates.io/tutorials/about/learn-how-to-build-a-mean-stack-application
https://angular-templates.io/tutorials/about/learn-angular-from-scratch-step-by-step

With added docker files for containerization practice.
